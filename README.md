# On-policy vs. Off-policy (Sarsa vs. Q-learning)
<b>Gabriele Prato, McGill University</b><br/>

In this notebook, we will be comparing Sarsa and Q-learning, an on-policy and off-policy control algorithm, on the Windy Gridworld environment described in the class textbook [1]. The goal will also be to observe how giving the agent more choice of actions affects its performance on the task.

Example 6.5, Exercices 6.7 and 6.8 will be implemented as well as the Sarsa and Q-learning algorithm.<br/>
